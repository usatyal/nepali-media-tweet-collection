@shakyanepal The present strategy of China doesn't just concern Nepal. China's strategy is to enter in local level secondly it is making it's way nationally and regionally. And India came up with the look east policy. — Mahendra P Lama #KantipurConclave,Feb 08 2020 
@shakyanepal We just don't live with our neighbors but we live with the world. We should increase our connectivity specially physical connectivity. We have to have at least two doors as no nation can survive by opening only a single door.— Chaitanya Mishra #KantipurConclave,Feb 08 2020

@shakyanepal Nepal is moving away from it's total dependence on India. Nepal's trade and transit agreement with China is one of the cornerstone to achieve this goal after the 2015 blockade; & economic cooperation with China that links the Himalayas with the sea is another. — Mahesh Maskey,Feb 08 2020

@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The notion of justice is different for different people.

@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The issues of women have never been a political issue. Even when we look at the demographics there is no bigger political issue than the issue of women. — @manushiyb,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti We have to talk about sex consent and pleasure. And only by creating an environment that lets us discuss about these issues we can move towards the right direction in the #MeToo Too conversation. — @durgakrk #KantipurConclave https://t.co/1GFYgqWnd4,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The issues of women are not considered as political issues in Nepal. — @manushiyb #KantipurConclave https://t.co/13pmhGI8yo,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti We looked at Me Too just as a movement certain personal stories. Me Too is just not about the few stories that came to light. The ultimate goal of the Me Too is create a society free of sexual violence. — @durgakrk,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti We can put a stop to incidents of sexual violence and misconduct only through collective effort. But we should not be afraid to name the perpetrators. — @manushiyb,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti Those who conduct sexual violence and misconduct must be named and made public and the victims who share their stories must be respected. — @manushiyb https://t.co/Ulhd9kcezE,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti When reports of Me Too broke in the theater sector in order to address the issue we held meetings with the victims and the accused. But moreover the victims were ridiculed and there were also cases of victim blaming without even considering the idea of consent. — Akanchha Karki,Feb 08 2020

@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The reason behind victims not coming out is because of the rule of deep culture of patronage. — @durgakrk,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The active Student Unions of the Tribhuvan University did not respond to the incidents of sexual violence and misconduct for a long time even after the stories of those incidents came in the media. — @manushiyb #KantipurConclave,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The stories of Me Too that came to light were about the suffering of victims on a personal level as well as stories of women who have been suffering from ages in our communities. We need to have specific organisations that will address the grievances of the victims. — @manushiyb,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti While some of us are afraid because we know the victims personally and we don't want to jeopardize our personal and professional relations because of Me Too. — Akanchha Karki,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The reason behind the movement being feeble is that we are afraid to open up. Some are afraid that the works they have done in the past will be dragged into the onus of the movement. — Akanchha Karki,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti The reason behind Me Too movement not being able to gain momentum in Nepal is because it is related to sex. In Nepal sex is a matter of honor. This became one of the reason behind victims not wanting to open about the harassment. — Akanchha Karki,Feb 08 2020 
@durgakrk @manushiyb @bbhrikuti Many victims sexual harassment could not come out and report about because they were subjected to many questions regarding the incidents. — @bbhrikuti,Feb 08 2020

@NamitaGokhale_ @itisha It's the connect between the people the collective emotions that are evoked that gives real connectivity. Sometimes words can trap us and one of the improtant thing about literary connectivity is translations.— @NamitaGokhale_,Feb 08 2020

@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 The government's mentality of seeking immediate solution is not going to solve the problem of climate change. There needs to be broader long term plans. — @manjeetdhakal #KantipurConclave https://t.co/EVuPrc43to,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 Second point is that we Nepal needs to have a louder voice in calling out nations contributing to climate change. We need to speak up more. There is no time to be polite we need to take leadership from the youths to all the way to senior leaders of the country.— @arnicopanday,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 Two key roles Nepal can play other than being the victim of climate change one is to set examples we are more agile and can do more than the big countries to fight climate change. — @arnicopanday,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 To address climate change and sustainable development goals for a long term inclusion of people form every sectors of life in decision making is the key. — @Bindu_Bhandari https://t.co/nNRr7EZAHQ,Feb 08 2020

@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 We need to make sure that there is inclusion in tackling the climate change so that there will be holistic approach in addressing the issue in the long term. — @Bindu_Bhandari,Feb 08 2020

@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 The long term vision is to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius. To do that we cannot wait until the end of this century. Every year form now up to 2030 the emission has to be reduced by 7.6 degree Celsius. — @manjeetdhakal,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 We will be the country that will be facing a huge impact of climate change because of our capacity to respond the system we have been placed and the infrastructure which has not been well developed. — @manjeetdhakal,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 What is holding us back to take action against climate change? In my experience it is the greediness of some politicians business leaders and so on. — @manjeetdhakal,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 Also we need to exercise the rights given by our democracy and government and be able to actively exercise the democratic rights given to us and incorporate ourselves into the system. — @Bindu_Bhandari,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 The global average temperature for the past 100 years has already risen by about 1 degree Celsius. If we rely on plans the countries have presented the temperature will go beyond three degree Celsius which will be very difficult for us to adapt with. — @manjeetdhakal https://t.co/pxQf9yC9Uv,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 With all the knowledge we have about the science regarding climate we need to translate them into the accessible language. And we can use the digital technology including social media to convey the message. — @Bindu_Bhandari,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 There is no silver bullet in tackling climate change and every action counts. We as young people should be informed about the climate science. — @Bindu_Bhandari,Feb 08 2020

@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 Only relying on the funding and support that we receive our future will not be easy to deal with. If our ice are melting jobs are in problem tourism is in difficult situation then that's not going to help. — @manjeetdhakal,Feb 08 2020 
@arnicopanday @Bindu_Bhandari @manjeetdhakal @SnehaPandey92 Anything that is fossil fuel powered needs to go down there is no choice.— @arnicopanday,Feb 08 2020
